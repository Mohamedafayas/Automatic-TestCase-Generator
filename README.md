## 📜 Project Description

The Automatic Test Case Generator is a Python-based tool designed to help developers efficiently generate test cases for competitive programming problems. It provides automated solutions for creating test cases for array and string operations, making it easier for coders and coding platform creators to validate code correctness with dynamic test generation.

The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of generating diverse test cases for coding challenges and automated validation.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Test Case Generation**: Automatically generates test cases for array and string operations based on user input.

- **1D Array Operations**: Supports operations such as sum, product, reverse, sort, prefix sum, and suffix sum on 1D arrays.

- **2D Matrix Operations**: Handles operations like diagonal sum, matrix transpose, spiral printing, zigzag printing, and lower triangular matrix generation for 2D arrays.

- **String Operations**: Includes functionality for reversing strings, converting to uppercase, lowercase, palindrome checking, vowel counting, and substring counting.

- **Edge Case Handling**: Incorporates robust handling for empty arrays, matrices, and strings to ensure accurate outputs in all situations.

- **Formatted Output**: Provides clean and formatted output for easy readability and debugging.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **GUI Integration**: Develop a graphical user interface to allow users to interact with the tool more easily.

- **More Operations**: Add additional operations for more complex data structures like graphs and linked lists.

- **Custom Test Case Generation**: Allow users to customize the properties of generated test cases (e.g., size, range, etc.).

- **Performance Optimization**: Improve efficiency for handling large input sizes and complex operations.

- **UI/UX Design Website**: Develop a web-based interface with a focus on user experience and design, making the tool more accessible and intuitive.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Python**: For implementing the test case generator logic and handling array, matrix, and string operations.

- **Regular Expressions**: Used for validating input data formats (e.g., for phone numbers and emails).

- **CLI-based Interaction**: User interacts with the tool through the command line for input/output.

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/automatic-test-case-generator.git
      ```
      
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:  
   ```bash
   cd automatic-test-case-generator
   ```

3. **Run the script**:  
   ```bash
   python test_case_generator.py
   ```


4. Provide input based on the operation you want to perform, such as array operations, string manipulations, or matrix operations.

5. The program will automatically generate test cases, and the results will be displayed in the terminal.
